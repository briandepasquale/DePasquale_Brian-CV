I conduct research in theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. Presently, I work with Carlos Brody and Jonathan Pillow on latent variable models of evidence accumulation. During my Ph.D. I worked with Larry Abbott on supervised learning in recurrent neural networks. Before that I studied the basal ganglia in the laboratory of Ann Graybiel.
